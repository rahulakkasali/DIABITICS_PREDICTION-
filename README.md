## ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction â€“ Model Deployment

This project demonstrates **end-to-end deployment of a scikit-learn machine-learning model** for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health metrics.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights
- **Model**: Logistic Regression (scikit-learn) trained on a diabetes dataset  
- **Workflow**: Data preprocessing â†’ model training â†’ serialization with `joblib` â†’ web service integration  
- **Deployment**: Served via a lightweight Flask API for real-time predictions  
- **Environment**: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Flask, HTML/CSS (basic front end)

### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome
I practiced the full pipeline of:
1. Preparing and cleaning medical data  
2. Building and tuning a predictive model  
3. Packaging and deploying the model to a production-like environment so users can submit data and receive live predictions.
